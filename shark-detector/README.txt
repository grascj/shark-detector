Christopher Grasing & Kim Allan


1. Installation
	
	To install the extension open up chrome and go to chrome://extensions/ and select "Load unpacked extension".

	Then all you must do is make sure the extension is selected and you are good to go.


2. Usage

	Using the extension is as simple as browsing the web. Simply navigate to any website using http or https and it will take screenshots of the page at intervals.

	When you navigate back to a page the extension will compare images and when it finishes, the extension icon will be enabled and change to one of 3 icons:

		Green Checkmark:
			
			This signifies the page has had less than 20% change.

		Yellow Warning Sign:
			
			This signifies the page has between 20-40% change.

		Red Hazard Sign:

			The means the page has over 40% change. It's highly likely something fishy is going on.
